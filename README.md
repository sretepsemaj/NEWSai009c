A News Data Processing Studio for Creating News Shows and Papers

The goal of this project is to gather comprehensive news data on significant events and process it using an objective language model. Our aim is to provide a full spectrum of truthful and objective stories.

We believe that transparency in how we produce news will make a significant positive impact.

1. the workflow is reporter find the new with the llama-sonar-perplexity model super awesomne source finding software (i hope havn't contacted perplexity but did watch the lex fridman with the plex guy, they are trying too)
2. the director can then take the generated reporter story and make a  generated teleprompter script.
3. the anchorman is trained and delivers the script in a virtual show and we will train the coolest anhorman ever, maybe we get jon stewart maybe we get lex fridman maybe we get Tom Brokaw, maybe we do them all. lol with permission of course.
4. anyway this project is more that just news it could lead to a information mapping system that could be groundbreeaking and help lawyers and doctors and building departments sift through information with easy and be ablt to make sure the informatrion matches the source.
